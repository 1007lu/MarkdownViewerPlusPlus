## Personal Note
*I don't know if this is very useful for a lot of people but I wanted something in private to quickly write and see some formatted Markdown documents. As I was not able to find something similar very quickly I created this project. I hope this proves useful to you... with all its Bugs and Issues ;) If you like it you can give me a shout at [INsanityDesign][1] or let me know via this repository.*
